# Solar-Radiation-
The project aims at identifying the Solar Radiation at any given time of day and month. The dataset is taken from kaggle (link: https://www.kaggle.com/dronio/SolarEnergy/download). In this project, we will fit a XGBoost Regression Model and determine the hyperparameter values using the Optuna library.
